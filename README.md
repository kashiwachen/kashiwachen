### Hi there 👋
My name is Oscar, a new graduate student who just starts his career in 2020.
I like trying new stuff and agree with the idea that we should keep learning in our whole life.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on the web development and part of backend stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning knowledge of database structure, batch processing, stream processing, and AirFlow.
I want to make a complete framework for data processing, storage and management. (<-- Gonna make this more detailed in the future)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on kaggle competitions, looking forward to someone to guide me to have fast output.
I have read several guidlines about how to do the competitions, but none of them help me to have fast output. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with the career path in data engineer. I don't have enought experience in exploring the insight of data so I think deploy the infrastructure for data analysis is a good start.

Sometimes I even think I should have been a cook or worked in a alchohol factory
