### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Oscar, a new graduate student who just starts his career in 2020.
Currently, I am learning and working along the career path as a data engineer.
Compare to being a data scientist, I find it's more fun to build up the data processing system as a data engineer even though sometimes we need to play in "dirt" because of the variety of data itself.
For me, it's quite exciting to see the system working automatically and reducing the unnecessary manual effort.
I like trying new stuff and am agree with the idea that we should keep learning in our whole life.
I am living in Tokyo, so if you want to work or play with me feel free to contact me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the backend system: web server, database and data pipeline.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning knowledge of database structure, batch processing, stream processing, and Airflow.
I want to make a complete framework for data processing, storage and management. (<-- Gonna make this more detailed in the future)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on kaggle competitions, looking forward to someone to guide me to have fast output.
I have read several guidlines about how to do the competitions, but none of them helps me to have fast output.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help about the career path as data engineer. I don't have enought experience in exploring the insight of data so I think deploy the infrastructure for data analysis is a good start.
- âš¡ Interest: cooking & drinking & outdoor activity(e.g. hiking, cycling, basketball etc.).
Sometimes I even think I should have been a cook or worked in a bar.
