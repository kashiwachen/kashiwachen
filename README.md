### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Oscar, a new graduate student who just starts his career in 2020.
Currently, I am still a little confused of my career path so I am gonna try stuff as much as possible and as soon as possible to figure it out. 
I like trying new stuff and agree with the idea that we should keep learning in our whole life.
I am living in Tokyo, so if you want to work or play with me feel free to contact me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the web development and part of backend stuff.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning knowledge of database structure, batch processing, stream processing, and AirFlow.
I want to make a complete framework for data processing, storage and management. (<-- Gonna make this more detailed in the future)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on kaggle competitions, looking forward to someone to guide me to have fast output.
I have read several guidlines about how to do the competitions, but none of them help me to have fast output. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the career path in data engineer. I don't have enought experience in exploring the insight of data so I think deploy the infrastructure for data analysis is a good start.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: pochiachen0321@gmail.com 
- âš¡ Interest: Cooking & drinking & Outdoor activity(e.g. Hiking, Cycling, Basketball etc.).
Sometimes I even think I should have been a cook or worked in a alchohol factory
