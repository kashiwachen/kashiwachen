### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Oscar, a new graduate student who just starts his career in 2020.
Currently, I am learning and working along the career path as a data engineer.
Compare to being a data scientist, I find it's more fun to build up the data processing system and ML pipeline as a data engineer even though sometimes we need to play in "dirt" because of the variety of data and ML processes.
For me, it's quite exciting to see the system working automatically and reducing the unnecessary manual efforts.
I like trying new stuff and embrace lifelong learning.
I am living in Tokyo, so if you want to work or play with me feel free to contact me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the backend system development, including RESTful API, database, CLI, ELT pipeline and a little bit MLOps.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the knowledge of data engineering and DevOps(MLOps).
I want to make a useful framework for data processing, storage and management to support the data scientist team better.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaboration on kaggle competitions.
I have read several guidlines about how to do the competitions, but none of them helps me to have fast output.
I am looking forward to a collaborator from whom I can learn to have output fastly.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help about the career path as data engineer.
I don't have enought experience in exploring the insight of data so I think deploy the infrastructure for data analysis is a good start.
- âš¡ Interest: cooking & drinking & outdoor activity(e.g. hiking, cycling, basketball etc.).
Sometimes I even think I should have been a cook :joy:.
