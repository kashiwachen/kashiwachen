This is Oscar.
I like trying new stuff and embrace lifelong learning.
I am living in Tokyo, so if you want to work or play with me feel free to contact me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the backend system development, including API(REST and GraphQL), database(Postgres and MongoDB) and CLI(Typer), and a little bit MLOps.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the knowledge of data engineering, some frontend stuff(bun and react), and DevOps(tend to focus on MLOps more). Compare to being a data scientist, I find it's more fun to build up the data processing system and ML pipeline as a data engineer even though sometimes we need to play in "dirt" because of the variety of data and ML processes.
I want to make a useful framework for data processing, storage and management to support the data scientist team better.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help about the career path as data engineer.
I don't have enought experience in exploring the insight of data so I think deploy the infrastructure for data analysis is a good start.
- âš¡ Interest: cooking & drinking & outdoor activity(e.g. workout, bouldering, hiking, basketball).
Sometimes I even think I should have been a cook :joy:.
